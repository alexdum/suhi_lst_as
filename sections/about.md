Built in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/", target="_blank"> R </a> using 
<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/", target="_blank">
Shiny </a>, this dashboard aims to provide accurate and relevant facts
and statistics about SUHI for large cities located in WMO Region 6. 

The application is based
on  <a href = "https://landsaf.ipma.pt/en/products/land-surface-temperature/lst/" target="_blank"> LSA-SAF SEVIRI LST All Sky </a> dataset.

The administrative boundaries for all the cities used in this study were extracted from 
 <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#10_admin_level_values_for_specific_countries", target="_blank"> OpenStreetMap </a>.
 
 The Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) is detected for each city using the methodology proposed by  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095521002868", target="_blank">  Cheval et al. (2022) </a>.
